# CNN-for-Paderborn-Bearing-Dataset
in Python
In this repository, I want to share my code which applying 1D CNN to Paderborn Bearing Dataset
Users can specify which type of sensor they are going to use: 'force', 'phase_current_1', 'phase_current_2', 'speed', 'temp_2_bearing_module', 'torque','vibration_1'
take a look to files: 'helper.py', 'train_helper.py', and 'nn_model.py' to understand what I'd done.
